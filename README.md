A dynamic UI theme for Atom that (kinda) follows Google's Material Design Guidelines. Best with [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax).

Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

# Installation

Fire up a console and type:

```shell
apm install tapioca-ui
```

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.

# Configuration

Atom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.
