# This is the TAPIOCA theme, baby! :tada:

Oh yeah! This theme is still under development. BUT, I've done it with love for you! That's right! FOR YOU :heart:

Now, atention: This project was forked from the amazing [Atom Material UI Theme](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-ui), then any similarity is not mere coincidence :wink:

# Installation

Fire up a console and type:

```shell
apm install tapioca-ui
```

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.

# Configuration

Atom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.
